/**
 * Streaming assistant speech-vocalization.
 *
 * The vocalizer turns the assistant's STREAMING output into spoken audio as a
 * side effect of the normal turn. Text deltas are streamed *straight into the
 * TTS engine* ({@link Vocalizer.pushDelta} → the worker's incremental text
 * input): the engine splits the running text at sentence boundaries and emits
 * one audio chunk per sentence, which a single {@link StreamingAudioPlayer}
 * plays back gaplessly. So the assistant starts speaking sentence 1 while later
 * sentences are still being generated — low latency, never overlapping.
 *
 * Overspeech control:
 * - {@link clear} stops playback instantly (kills the player) and aborts
 *   in-flight synthesis — wired to a new turn, an Esc/Ctrl+C interrupt, and a
 *   sent message.
 * - {@link duck}/{@link unduck} lower/restore the volume while the user is
 *   speaking (push-to-talk), so the assistant doesn't talk over them.
 * - Sessions are chained, so sequential utterances queue and drain in order
 *   rather than overlapping.
 *
 * Errors are swallowed (debug-logged) so a synthesis or playback failure never
 * throws into the turn. A process-level singleton ({@link vocalizer}) is shared
 * by the event controller (streaming deltas) and the ask tool (spoken questions).
